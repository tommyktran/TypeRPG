#About
This is a simple prototype for a typing game. Type to attack the enemies, the better your WPM and accuracy, the more damage you do. Then the enemy will attack you, and you will have a chance to defend against the attack with a reaction - the better you do on the reaction, the less damage you take (or no damage at all, if it's perfect).

#Features
* Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application. - The prompts used in the game for attacking and for reactions are stored in an array and selected at random.
* Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputes, and returns a new value. - The calculateWPMDamageMultiplier() function uses different formulas to calculate damage based on the typing accuracy, and returns the damage multiplier as a result.
* Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph). - After successfully completing a prompt, information about the player's typing is displayed below, including WPM, accuracy, and the number of characters in the prompt.
